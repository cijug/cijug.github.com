April's meeting will be a continuation of March's continous delivery talk. This time, [Luke Amdor] will show how they release software at [Banno].

Last meeting, [Vincent Mutambuki] talked about the goals of continuous  delivery. This month, Luke will push a feature from dev to prod in front of our very eyes. Forget live coding, this is live production pushing.
