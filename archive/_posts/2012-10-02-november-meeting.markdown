November's meeting has [Toran Billups] of IMT Insurance talking about [ember.js].

With all the buzz around javascript these days it's hard to know what library or framework to learn and why. If you are interested in learning a framework that's opinionated and requires no jQuery glue code maybe ember.js is for you. Join me for a discussion about why I decided it was time to use a real framework on the client side and how it changed the way I write javascript today. I'll start with a simple client side only CRUD app and quickly evolve it into a fully REST backed client side app showing how ember.js and ember-data reduce the amount of code you need to write and object state you need to keep track of yourself. Some knowledge of javascript is recommended but not required.
