Last month we took an informal survey of possible meeting topics. One
of the more popular requests was [Gradle]. Fortunately for us, [Matt
Payne] of the [Omaha Java User Group] knows a thing or two about this
topic.

He has agreed to make the trip to Des Moines to talk about the next
evolution of build tools. Tired of the XML in [Ant]? Read about the
[Maven problems] and think there's a better way?

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.
