February's meeting is all about automated acceptance testing. What it is and how do you do it.

We'll look at two popular tools [Fitnesse] and [CucumberJVM] and how you
can write documentation valuable to both business and developers.
Then see how these docs stay current by integrating them into the [CI]
environment.

[CucumberJVM]: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm
