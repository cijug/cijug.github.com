Are you a [Subversion] or [CVS] user and heard the hype about
[Git] but aren't sure how to get there?

[Cecil Williams] of [Source Allies] will discuss his experience converting a client from
Subversion to Git. Both the why and the how.

Rehan Shariff from [John Deere ISG] will talk about how they leverage
[Github]'s pull request model to keep builds green. He'll cover the
basics of [Github], pull requests, and automated code inspection checks on
the pull request.
