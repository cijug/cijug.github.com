June's meeting has [Spencer Herzberg] of [Source Allies] delving
into devops with [Docker].

Tired of managing code and infrastructure differences between your dev, test and prod environments? Need isolated application environments versions quickly and seamlessly? Never want to install Java, Postgres, or your favorite tool again? Docker is for you. Come learn how modern linux containerization can speed your application deployment and development.

You will learn about what Docker is, how to use it for local development and how to move your code and infrastructure to a prod environment. The last half of the presentation will be discussion format with time to talk through how to get your environment up and running on Docker containers.

Docker's on Google's radar and has [big plans] for it in their hosted
environments.

[Spencer Herzberg] is half devops, half developer who is passionate about agile development and automation. He works for [Source Allies] in Des Moines where he works on a wide variety of languages, frameworks and infrastructure.
