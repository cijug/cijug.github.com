Our apologies for the late notice.  In March, we are excited to have [Tim Gifford][tim] speak on Operations First Delivery.

DevOps lore tell legendary tales of "Unicorn" companies. WeÂ’re told these mythical companies continuously deliver software to production with nary a blemished aura or mussed mane. Can it be so? Is this but a fairytale?

In this talk, we will dispel the fantasy and show you how to get similar results. Spawning the first unicorn is the most difficult, so I will show you the specific steps, tools, techniques and architectural patterns of Operations First Delivery to create your first "Unicorn" project.
