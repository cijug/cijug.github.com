May's CIJUG has independent software professional [Robert G Greathouse] talking about service architecture using [Spring Boot] and service discovery using [Netflix Eureka Server].

So you want to start building a system made up of small services like you read on the latest blogs. Contrary to most of those articles, it is not as simple as breaking up your existing system into smaller pieces. There are a lot of things that are usually left unsaid. One of which is dynamic service discovery.

Wondering how to serve an http application without using a heavy app server? See how [Spring Boot] lets you get up and running in a matter of minutes.

Not quite sure how to load balance between internal, private services without using a traditional load balancer? See how client-side load balancing works using Eureka.
