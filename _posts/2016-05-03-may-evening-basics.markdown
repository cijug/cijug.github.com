What tools do you use when you start a brand new JVM project?  In our May meeting, we will step through all of the tools and frameworks that are commonly used while working on a Java, Scala, or Groovy project.  Included will be an opinionated overview of IntelliJ, Maven, Spring, GitHub, and Jenkins.

This will not be just a talk though.  Bring your laptops as we will work through setting up and using some of the features of these tools.  You might want to download and install IntelliJ Community Edition to help get started.

Also, since this is a workshop, you should feel free to bring your own tools and framework stacks and show us how you work!

We look forward to seeing you there!
