The industry has been buzzing about Agile for a long time, but what is it? Oh sure, you can search the web for Scrum or eXtreme Programming and get a pretty good oveview of the practices you’ve undoubtedly heard of or become familiar with. The problem is that standups, sprints, and pair programming are just the mechanics. Join us to move beyond the mechanics and discover why the Agile Values and Principles provide a powerful framework for modern software development and delivery for you and your business.

Our speaker for this month will be Brandon Carlson from Lean TECHniques.  Since starting his career in 1995, Brandon has held positions from development and architecture to management—and he’s still learning. Passionate about elevating the performance of IT as a whole, he has helped numerous organizations from startups to Fortune 100 companies improve their product development and delivery systems. 

The meeting will be on December 8th at 6:00 PM at the new Source Allies office in Urbandale.  The address is 4501 NW Urbandale Dr, Urbandale, IA 50322.
