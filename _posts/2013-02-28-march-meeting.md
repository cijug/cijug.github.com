March's meeting has [Vincent Mutambuki] talking about continous deployment.

Getting software released is a tricky proposition for some organizations. In some organizations, releases become all night events full of tense moments and fear. After several failed releases, management might show you the door. 

Delivering software should be a non-event. We will discuss software delivery patterns at the heart of which is the delivery pipeline. Starting at the developers workspace, we will discuss incrementally automating software delivery states. Culminating with continuous deployment, improved quality, speed and confidence.
