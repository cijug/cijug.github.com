Have you heard the buzz words Serverless Architecture, Cloud Scale, or Microservice? In this talk we'll quickly overview Azure Functions and AWS Lambdas and provide some examples where they might be useful. We'll cover the basics of spinning up a function/lambda within both cloud providers, how to debug and monitor them, and demo their local dev toolsets. With a wide variety of integrations and many supported languages (C#, JavaScript, Python), functions/lambdas are a relatively quick, easy, and cheap way to spin up a cloud service that can scale easily!
