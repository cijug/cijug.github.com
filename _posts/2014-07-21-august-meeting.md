At [July's] meeting, [Ken Sype] recommended when starting a new project,
use the most powerful language available, not the most familiar. One language
he thought was powerful was [Clojure]. 

[Clojure] has the expressivity of LISP, the practicality of the JVM and the discipline of immutability by default. It's a practical language
that many people are using to solve real world problems. [Ryan Senior] currently works for [Puppet Labs] on the open source, Clojure-based
[PuppetDB] project. At last count, [PuppetDB] was installed on over 50,000 servers. He has been using [Clojure] for over four years on
projects ranging from basic web apps to query engines. Come hear him talk about the benefits of the [Clojure] approach with plenty of code
examples and success stories.
