## Notes:
* This meeting will not be at our usual location, instead it will be at
<a href="/assets/PrincipalCampusMap.pdf">Principal Financial
Group (750 Park St downtown.)</a>  The meeting will be in the z-shaped building, in the southwest corner of the 1st floor.  The security entrance you’ll need to enter is also on the west side of the “Z” but on the north side.  You access that entrance from Park St.  Our security staff has asked attendees to park in lot L2, just north of the Z building.

* Due to seating constraints, we will need everyone to sign-up in
  advance. If you do not [sign-up], security will not let you in. 

Inspired by success stories from companies such as Amazon and Netflix, many organizations are moving towards microservice architectures at a brisk pace. This session provides a thorough overview of the pros and cons for microservice architectures, when it is applicable, and some nascent best practices.

Microservice architecture is important because it’s the first architecture to fully embrace the Continuous Delivery and DevOps revolutions. In this session, I cover the motivations for building a microservice architecture (including making the distinction between “regular SOA” and microservices), some considerations you must make before starting (such as transactions versus eventual consistency), how to determine service partition boundaries, and ten tips to dowse you towards success. I also discuss the role of polyglot development, enterprise governance, how data and databases fit into this new world, and tooling to help ensure consistency between core services like logging and monitoring. This session provides a thorough overview of the pros and cons for microservice architectures, when it is applicable, and some nascent best practices.
