August's meeting has [Dan Mullins] of [Meredith Publishing] talking about simplifying java web-app
complexity with [Dropwizard].

Ready for a life without [Spring]? Tired of using XML or annotations to hook two
classes together? Sick of Tomcat?

[Dropwizard] is the latest addition to the Java framework club. 
Instead of starting from scratch, they built on what's
already out there (minus [Spring]). [Jersey] for Rest, [Maven] for builds,
[JDBI] for persistnce, [Jetty] for the container. The goal is to make working with
restful services in Java simple again.
