September's meeting has [Ryan Bergman] of [John Deere] talking about the new [lambdas] coming in Java 8 and [Ying Zhang] of [Meredith Publishing] talking about [CSS3].

Lots of other languages have Lambdas, Java doesn't. Java's gotten a lot of mileage out of anonymous inner classes, but that all changes in Java 8. See an early release of how much less typing you'll have to do in the future.

[CSS3] is a collection of modules to help web developers support all the new screens out there. Custom fonts, curves, built-in grids will be all supported without needing a pre-compiler like [SASS] or [Compass].
