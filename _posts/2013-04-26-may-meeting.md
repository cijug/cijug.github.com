At May's meeting we will be talking about the smaller tools that make
our life easier: [LogStash], [Metrics], and JVM troubleshooting
with [VisualVM].

[Zach Cox] of [Pongr] fame will talk about Yammer's open-source
real-time metrics tool called [Metrics].

Kevin Nuckolls of [Banno] will talk about the benefits of centralizing
your logs using [LogStash]. Once you consolidate them, you can
search, parse, and mine the data.

[Rich Harms], the CTO at [Right Stuf] will discuss JVM memory analysis
with [VisualVM].
