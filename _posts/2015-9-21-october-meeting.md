Our next meeting has two speakers making their [CIJUG] debut. First off, [Ajdin Hedzic][ajdin] of [Principal Financial Group][Principal] will talk about securing your application with [Spring Security]. Then [Sean Mooney] of [Source Allies] will show us some advanced [Git] tips and tricks.

Does your application need:

* [Authentication]?
* [Authorization]?
* Other security features?

If so, you'll want to know more about [Spring Security]. It doesn't even matter if you use the Spring Framework to take advantage of this functionality. It won't prevent [North Koreans from hacking your Wordpress admin pages][koreans], but it will keep your day job from making the news like [Ashley Madison], [Sony], and [Target].

Do you use [Git]? Feeling pretty good with such commands as:

* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`
* `git pull`

You might be surprised to know, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Come see what's lurking under the [Git] surface with [Sean Mooney].
