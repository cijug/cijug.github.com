One of the key practices to create quality software is Test Driven Development (TDD).  Come learn how automated tests and thinking about tests first can impact your design and help you create reliable software that is easier to change and does what is is supposed to do.  We will examine simple techniques used in application development today and demonstrate TDD in action.

Our speaker Greg Orton has spent over a decade creating applications using TDD.  He is the IT Development Manager at Iowa Student Loan where TDD is an integral part of the extreme programming practices that support their agile software development projects
