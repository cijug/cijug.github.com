Our speaker will be Andrew Zumwalt from Sogeti.  He will talk to us about UI and UX, what the similarities are and differences are, and help us understand what really goes into trying to communicate with your favorite digital device.

Andrew Zumwalt's digital passion started with 3D game design and engineering software, and designing web interfaces about 22 years ago. His passion put him on the path of software alongside digital art. He currently works for Sogeti and is contracted at John Deere.

The meeting will be on the 9th at 6:00 PM at Businessolver.  We look forward to seeing you there!
