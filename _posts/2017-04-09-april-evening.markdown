Luke Amdor will be the speaker this month:

Jenkins Pipelines are a set of Jenkins jobs and plugins on steroids with the power of a Groovy DSL to mix it all together. It allows one to model a simple to a very complex continuous delivery pipeline as code and checked in with the source code itself. Luke will go through how to use a Jenkinsfile from scratch all the way through deploying a Github project across environments using Kubernetes. Along the way, he’ll go over some of the gotcha’s and breakthroughs that he’s learned while implementing this for his projects.
