Note the updated meeting date/time. Due to speaker conflict, our meeting will be delayed a week.

Are you no longer satisfied with programming in Java? Have you been eyeing Scala, Clojure, Groovy, or Go and thought how great it would be to do that at your day job? Then you look at the other 6 people on your team and think, "there's no way any of these people will go for it". Then proceed to fire up IntelliJ, resume coding in Java 6 and put those new language dreams behind you.

Wouldn't it be nice to ask someone who's done this these questions?

1. Why did you do it?
2. How did you convince others it was a good idea?
3. How did you train?
4. What did the codebase look like afterwards?
5. Was it successful?
6. Would you do it again?

This month, we have two people who have done this. David Watson of [Iowa Student Loan][isl] and Central Iowa's Groovy expert (according to [Dan Dudley][dud]) will talk about their experiences switching to Groovy and Grails.

Then we have [Luke Amdor][luke] of [Bano] who has worked extensively with Java, Ruby, Scala, and so many others, it would be easier to list the three he hasn't. He will talk about his experiences moving to Scala and their ever evolving DevOps stack.
