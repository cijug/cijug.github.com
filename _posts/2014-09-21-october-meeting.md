Do you live in the Java world, but wonder what's going
on in [Bizarro .Net World][biz]?

Curious what a day in the life of a .Net developer looks like? [Nate
Buwalda] will shed some light on Microsoft's latest offerings.

Curious what a day in the life of a Java developer looks like? [Dan
Mullins] will give you his take on Java development.

Beyond [C# vs Java][vs], we'll compare and contrast the supporting cast:

* Up-front Investment
* IDE
* Build Tools/Dependency Management
* Language Itself
* Preferred Web Framework
* Testing Framework (Functional/Unit)
* Appserver/Deployment Mechanism

If you're a .Net developer thinking about Java, or a Java developer
thinking about .Net, you'll find something interesting in this meeting.
