Our April meeting will be on 14th at 6:00 PM at Businessolver.  This month's meeting is a bit different from the ones we've had in the past.  We are going to take this opportunity figure out how we would like the user group to function moving forward.  The meeting will include discussion of the following topics:

Continued operations
Organization structure (and possible officer roles)
Meeting date and time
Number of meetings a year
Sponsorship
Speaker topics

Where possible, we will vote on each proposal.  Please be sure to attend if you feel passionate any of these topics. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
