March's meeting has accomplished author and [NFJS] speaker  **[Venkat Subramaniam]** talking about [Programming Reactive]. If you only attend one CIJUG meeting this year, this is the one you want. If you attend two meetings this year, attend this one and anything with [Dan Mullins].

## Notes:
* This meeting will not be at our usual location, instead it will be at
<a href="/assets/PrincipalCampusMap.pdf">Principal Financial
Group (750 Park Avenue Downtown Des Moines)</a>

* Due to seating constraints, we will need everyone to sign-up in
  advance. If you do not [sign-up], security will not let you in. 

Big data, smart phones, tablets, wearable devices, multicore processors,…—we're seeing rapid and drastic evolution in both the computing environments and the application needs. Thankfully, a number of technologies have been evolving over the past several years to meet these demands. The reactive manifesto is an attempt to reenforce a set of technical practices needed to meet the emerging demands.

If you've heard and read about reactive programming, but are eager to realize that in code, then this presentation is for you. We will start with a rapid introduction and get into code to learn about reactive programming, not in theory but with practical examples.
