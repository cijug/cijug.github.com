You’ve made the switch to agile. You stopped doing comprehensive documentation and you have self directed teams that value emergent design right? Then you notice that you forgot to give the architects something to do. Architecture is an activity that all teams need to perform and you might just have some experienced individuals around to help lead and guide them. In this presentation we will talk about what software architecture is, how teams accomplish it, and where the people traditionally called “architects” fit in an agile world.

Our speaker is Ryan Bergman. Ryan works for John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group where he works mostly on applications merging agronomic data from farm equipment with web applications. It’s pretty cool. He is a big fan of agile/xp software development and he speaks on the subject at user groups and conferences sometimes.

The meeting will be on October 13th at 6:00 PM at Businessolver.  We look forward to seeing you there!
