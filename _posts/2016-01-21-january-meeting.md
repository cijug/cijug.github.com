Our next meeting has [Chris Freeman][chris] helping you improve your technical chops.

Research tells us that intentional practice with immediate, accurate feedback is the only way to become an expert. But most refactoring and TDD books and online courses don't give you meaningful feedback. We will explore and practice TDD and Refactoring with automated feedback from [Industrial Logic]'s recording and analysis engines. We'll also discuss how to improve technical practices in the absence of such aids.
