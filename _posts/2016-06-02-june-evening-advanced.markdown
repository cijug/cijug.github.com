In todayâ€™s day and age, the idea of working remotely seems pretty trivial. However, doing so for an extended project with the whole team working remote poses its challenges. We will walk through techniques that have been successful for motivating, teaming, and collaborating remotely at John Deere.
 
The meeting will be on the 9th at 6:00 PM at Businessolver.  We look forward to seeing you there!
