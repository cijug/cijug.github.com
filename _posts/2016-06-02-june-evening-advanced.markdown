In todayâ€™s day and age, the idea of working remotely seems pretty trivial. However, doing so for an extended project with the whole team working remote poses its challenges. We will walk through techniques that have been successful for motivating, teaming, and collaborating remotely.
 
Our speaker will be Adam Brunner.  Adam has had the opportunity to work with both offshore and onshore teams over the past several years for John Deere ISG.  

The meeting will be on the 9th at 6:00 PM at Businessolver.  We look forward to seeing you there!
