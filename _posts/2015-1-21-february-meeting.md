At February's meeting, [Matthew Nuzum][nuz] of John Deere ISG will be giving
an intro to [Node.js] talk. Why would you [care about server side
Javascript][care]?

According to [Andrew Kirpalani][kirp] who is another local Node developer:

1. You're using JS both client and server side, the cognitive barrier
to switching tasks is much lower.
2. It's super fast.
3. It's asynchronous in the same way your front end should be, another
conceptual reuse that rocks
4. Huge community makes it super fast to pull things together.
