February's CIJUG has [Chris Freeman] talking about [Clojure]/Java interoperability.

[Clojure] is a JVM language, and as such you can call Java from Clojure and Clojure from Java. Usually.

Come learn how to leverage those Java libraries in your Clojure code.
Come learn how to reuse that Clojure you just wrote in your Java application.
We'll talk about when it works well, and when you'll want to buy that extra pizza for the long coding nights ahead.

We'll also talk about how to write tests in Clojure, and explore a few of the lein plugins which make your life easier.
