A ton has changed in the [Docker] ecosystem since [Spencer Herzberg] first [spoke] at the JUG. Even in the last few weeks. [Microsoft] support is really ramping up, Linux docker has changed quite a bit as well. Things are moving very quickly.

Most of us have heard about it, some are looking into it, but few Central Iowans outside of [Banno] have as much hands-on [Docker] experience.

* Curious what a container does to your development process?
* What's local development like? Especially if you're not running local Linux?
* How does [Continuous Integration][ci] change?
* How does your deployment change?
* Does it work with [WebSphere]?

Fresh from [MesosCon] and [Spencer] has a ton of best practices around deploying platforms that scale using Mesos. See how [Mesos] makes the most of your infrastructure.
