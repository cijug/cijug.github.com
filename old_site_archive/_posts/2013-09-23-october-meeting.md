In spite of what [Dan Mullins] said at August's meeting,
[Spring] is an extremely popular and widely used Java framework. That doesn't mean it has always been used well. Or the problems we've
had in the past haven't been resolved. 

October's meeting has [Nate Buwalda] of [Lean Techniques] discussing the
improvements in newer [Spring] releases. He'll also talk
Spring basics and best-practices to ensuring [Spring] apps start
and run smoothly.
