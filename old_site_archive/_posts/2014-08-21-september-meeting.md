September's meeting takes a break from technical skills to focus on the
business side of technology. 

Think you've got what it takes to survive outside the comfort and security of a full-time employer? [Dustin Thostenson] will talk about how to become an [independent
contractor]. Sure - you'll make [more money], but will they offset the more problems that come as a result. Find a contract, set aside taxes, full-price health care, and no vacation are all things you'll need to think about. 

Looking to make extra cash working on side programming projects? [Dan Mullins] can't tell you how to do it, but he can tell how not to do it.
Most developers are really good with technical problems, but side projects aren't just technical. You're now a company and need to think brand awareness, estimates and finding time to work.

Want to help your local user-group by giving a talk but aren't sure how to start? [Brian Hartin] is a recent [first-time
speaker] at the CIJUG and will talk about giving a talk. Subject, preparation, delivery, live-coding and other things to consider.
